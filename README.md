## ðŸ›  Model Training

* The model uses all available features from the HR dataset.
* Preprocessing includes label encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numeric variables.
* Feature engineering creates additional meaningful metrics such as:

  * YearsSincePromotionRatio
  * IncomePerYearOfExperience
  * AvgSatisfaction
  * YearsPerJobLevel
* Machine learning model: `RandomForestClassifier` and `Logistic Regression` from scikit-learn.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* All features must be provided for accurate predictions.
* Make sure `attrition_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` are in the same folder as `app.py`.
* The app is designed for demonstration and portfolio purposes.
